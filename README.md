COMP 4600 Final Project Notebook

I used the Google Collab file proivided in the link from https://k-d-w.org/blog/2019/07/survival-analysis-for-deep-learning/

In order to get the first two cells to work, I had to reinstall tensorflow to the correct version because I was getting compatability errors (It was tensorflow 2.2.0 when I installed it). These lines of code helped: 



!pip uninstall osqp -y

!pip install scikit-survival

!pip install tensorflow==1.13.1

Other than that I just followed the instructions in the .ipynb file. Everything ran through Google Collab without any issue. Simply pressing the run button on each cell compiled and ran the code.
